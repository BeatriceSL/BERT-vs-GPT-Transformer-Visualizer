# BERT-vs-GPT-Transformer-Visualizer
Visualizing BERT and GPT transformer models on a heatmap

The attempt to visualize the attention weights for two different pre-trained models: BERT and GPT. It tokenizes the input text, performs inference with each model, and then visualizes the attention weights using heatmaps.

Clone the repo to your Google Colab and run each code snippets after import dependencies.

** Requirements **
To install requirements:
!pip install transformers

Import transformers classes and functions from the HuggingFace Library on Google Colab.
